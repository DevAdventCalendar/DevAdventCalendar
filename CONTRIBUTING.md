## Pull Request
1. Fork it!

    We are using git-flow, so create branch `feature/new-feature` (for new features) or `hotfix/new-hotfix` (for fixing bugs).

    ```git
    git commit -m 'Add some feature'
    ```

5. Push to the branch

    ```git
    git push origin my-new-feature
    ```
    
6. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.

7. If necessary, update the documentation ([README.md](https://github.com/DevAdventCalendar/DevAdventCalendar/blob/master/README.md)).

8. Ensure the tests pass.

9. Make sure your code compiles without errors.

10. Create a pull request to `develop` branch (the template has already been created, simply complete it).
